                <p>The Future <br><br>
                    The future is the time after the past and present. Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics. Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end. In the Occidental view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected timeline that is anticipated to occur. In special relativity, the future is considered absolute future, or the future light cone.

                <p> The Past<br><br>
                    The Past, as the movie says has not much thrilling past experiences which can be justified for taking/ possessing the lead actress for a motive. But, one time watch movie. Every actor in this movie have made justification on their respective role and nice time pass horror movie. No strong story back up. Vedita has done exceptionally well. Good effort.
